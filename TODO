TODO:
1. assembler + linker
3. optimize instruction size in files
4. .data seems to be backwards and doesn't print properly (test-maker works)
	- printing works properly, but printf cuts digits if number is 0 (even hex)
6. fix printf offset (%*3?)+
7. remove .data section size requirement from file loading
8. assign values to opcode enums so that they won't change after inserting new instruction
DONE:
2. add OP_FWRITEB instruction (write byte)
